What kind of app you considered: 
A GitHub clone named "NotGithub" that allows multiple users to push 
and pull code to and from a shared repository simultaneously.

Why the original code is not thread-safe: 
The original code (Repository) does not use any synchronization mechanisms to ensure 
that only one thread can access the shared resource (the repository) at a time. 
This can lead to race conditions, where the code in the repository becomes 
unpredictable and incorrect results are produced.


How you revised it to be thread-safe: 
The revised code (ThreadSafeRepository) uses a lock to ensure that only one thread can access the 
shared resource (the repository) at a time. 
This prevents race conditions and ensures that the code in 
the repository is always correct.
